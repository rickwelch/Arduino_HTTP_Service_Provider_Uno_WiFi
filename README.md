#### Arduino HTTP Service Provider - Uno WiFi Rev2

  _Provide an HTTP service that an allows an external server to poll or control embedded devices._

_*This project was built using PlatformIO and CLion._

This is a generic starting point for future web-enabled Arduino projects that will also be open sourced.  It is configured as an [Example Project](https://rickwelch.github.io/JSON_Example_Project/) that should provide an easy framework for modification to create custom web-enabled controllers.

For more information on how to make these modifications see the README.md files in the ~/include and ~/lib directories. Device drivers are in ~/lib and the configuration and setup are done in ~/include.
